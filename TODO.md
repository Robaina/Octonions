# Change the name of the basis

Definitely change the name of the basis and use the one in the picture. It makes so much more sense since you can see the two copies of the quaternions in the octonion structure!

# Highlight subalgebras?

Perhaps we can show the quaternion subalgebras upon clicking on a node? Each node participate in at least 3 of these subalgebras.
